Uses the Encog machine learning library found here: http://www.heatonresearch.com/encog/

Performs Hyperparameter tuning, training, and testing for the following networks:

  * Multilayer Perceptron
  * Elman Simple Recurrent Neural Network
  * Jordan Simple Recurrent Neural Network

Right now it's set up for regression on the data sets in the resources directory, but it can be edited for other datasets.
